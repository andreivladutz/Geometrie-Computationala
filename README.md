# Polygon-Triangulation<br/>
The C++ program receives the coordinates for a polygon to triangulate an outputs the triangulated polygon to a .json file which is then loaded
inside a small webapp that illustrates the triangulation process step by step. <br/>
The program also receives a point, highlighting the triangle containing the specified point.<br/><br/>
